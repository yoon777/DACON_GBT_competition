Floors made of painted pebbles decorated Ancient Greek- period inner courts and rooms. Early Christian churches in Crimea and Kyiv were decorated with mosaics made of marble of various colors, limestone, and bricks. These mosaics were crafted from small cube-shaped stones (tesserae) measuring approximately 4\\u20136 cm x 3\\u20135 cm, set in a limestone mortar or cement. Motifs include, but are not limited to, geometric patterns, palmettes, depictions of people, bor- ders with meanders, waves, braids, pairs of animals, and griffins. They show a variety of colors, including black, white, dark blue, and brown. Approximate date: 700 B.C.E.\\u20131774 C.E. 5. Miniature Columns and Small Altars\\u2014Used to decorate shrines, burials, and churches, miniature columns range in size from 10 to 100 cm high and could be rounded, fluted, twisted, or composed of semi- columns. Made primarily of white marble, gray limestone, or shell rock. Small altars are movable architectural structures with rectan- gular or rounded bases, sometimes column-shaped with a shallow round surface, ranging in height from 10 cm to 1 m. These items are found at Ancient Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Medieval sites. Ap- proximate date: 650 B.C.E.\\u20131774 C.E. 6.

Id. \\u00b6 14. There are three levels of culpability under 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592: (1) negligence; (2) gross negligence; and (3) fraud. 19 C.F.R. pt. 171, app. B(C) (2023). \\u201cAs a general rule, a violation is negligent if it results from failure to exercise reasonable care and competence.\\u201d Id. (empha- sis added). In comparison, gross negligence and fraud have height- ened mens rea culpability levels; where grossly negligent violations are done with actual knowledge of or wanton disregard, and fraudu- lent violations are the result of a known material false statement, omission, or act. Id. The court has previously explained that these three culpability levels are distinct from one another, and only one may be pleaded at the complaint stage: It is clear that the three alternative theories of liability recog- nized by 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592 are mutually exclusive. See 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592(a)(1) (1999) (indicating that a violation may occur \\u201cby fraud, gross negligence or negligence\\u201d). Congress\\u2019 use of the word \\u201cor\\u201d indicates that a choice must be made among the three theories; for purposes of determining penalty liability under 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592, a person who commits a customs violation may not have more than one mens rea at the time of commission. United States v. Pan Pac. Textile Grp., Inc., 395 F. Supp. 2d, 1244, 1258 (CIT 2005). The Supreme Court has further instructed that it is the function of a claim, not the form, that guides a lawsuit by explaining the ele- ments of a claim will guide the suit throughout litigation. Comcast Corp. v. Nat\\u2019l Ass\\u2019n of Afr. Am.-Owned Media, 589 U.S. 327, 332 (2020). In Comcast Corp., the Court held that while the difficulty to satisfy the elements of a claim may increase, the elements themselves do not change: Normally, too, the essential elements of a claim remain constant through the life of a lawsuit. What a plaintiff must do to satisfy\",\n          \"77 CUSTOMS BULLETIN AND DECISIONS, VOL. 58, NO. 38, SEPTEMBER 25, 2024 Despite those efforts, a group of experts submitted a report to the International Whaling Commission (\\u201cIWC\\u201d)4 Scientific Committee in 2017 that calculated the Maui dolphin\\u2019s potential biological removal level (\\u201cPBR\\u201d).5 See First Suppl. Compl. \\u00b6 57. That study indicated that in order for the Maui dolphin\\u2019s stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable level, the subspecies can sustain the human- induced loss of only one individual roughly every 20 years. Id. Ac- cording to another 2019 study considered by the IWC, the estimated mean annual bycatch mortality for Maui dolphins in recent years was 1.8 to 2.4 individuals per year. See id. \\u00b6 58. That bycatch mortality rate vastly exceeded the PBR estimated by the 2017 report. Plaintiffs also argued that New Zealand\\u2019s TMP since 2007 fell far short of a recommendation by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (\\u201cIUCN\\u201d) to ban gill net and trawl net use from the shoreline to the 100-meter depth contour off the North Island within the Maui dolphin\\u2019s range, which Plaintiffs maintained included the waters off both the west and east coasts of the island. See id. \\u00b6 58. New Zealand initiated a process to revise its TMP for Hector\\u2019s and Maui dolphins in 2018. See First Suppl. Compl. \\u00b6 80; N.Z. Answer \\u00b6\\u00b6 44, 67. Throughout this litigation New Zealand has disputed, among other facts, the IWC study\\u2019s estimation of the PBR, the ongoing mortality rate, the attribution of deaths exclusively to fishing, and the purported range of the Maui dolphin.

DISCUSSION Although nearly fifteen years have passed since the first entry of tires into the United States without payment of required duties for which Katana was the alleged importer of record, the lengthy admin- istrative history and considerable judicial resources which have al- ready been expended in refereeing the controversy between the gov- ernment and Katana do not change the procedural posture of the motions before the court: the parties\\u2019 respective motions are each upon the initial pleadings, the Defendant has not filed an answer to the government\\u2019s complaint, and the discovery process has not yet begun. The events which underlie the government\\u2019s claims and Ka- tana\\u2019s defenses are variously described and contested in both their substance and their import. Despite submitting and responding to a CIT Rule 56.3 statement, the parties have not yet established a body of undisputed facts that the court could rely upon in determining that no genuine dispute of any material fact exists. The court has only the parties\\u2019 pleadings and their representations made at oral argument upon which to base its determinations as to the propriety and per- suasiveness of the arguments set forth in their motions. That proce- dural posture informs and compels the court\\u2019s analysis and decisions below. I. Katana\\u2019s 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Is Denied A. The government sufficiently alleged the culpability level for an action under 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592(d). The first issue is whether the government asserted the proper level of culpability in its complaint. To survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint must show the court that the pleader is entitled to relief through well-pleaded facts accepted as true. In United States v. Blum, the Federal Circuit held that independent action can be brought for unpaid duties under 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592(d) without finding the requisite culpability level under 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592(a). 858 F.2d 1566, 1570 (Fed.

In comparison, gross negligence and fraud have height- ened mens rea culpability levels; where grossly negligent violations are done with actual knowledge of or wanton disregard, and fraudu- lent violations are the result of a known material false statement, omission, or act. Id. The court has previously explained that these three culpability levels are distinct from one another, and only one may be pleaded at the complaint stage: It is clear that the three alternative theories of liability recog- nized by 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592 are mutually exclusive. See 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592(a)(1) (1999) (indicating that a violation may occur \\u201cby fraud, gross negligence or negligence\\u201d). Congress\\u2019 use of the word \\u201cor\\u201d indicates that a choice must be made among the three theories; for purposes of determining penalty liability under 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592, a person who commits a customs violation may not have more than one mens rea at the time of commission. United States v. Pan Pac. Textile Grp., Inc., 395 F. Supp. 2d, 1244, 1258 (CIT 2005). The Supreme Court has further instructed that it is the function of a claim, not the form, that guides a lawsuit by explaining the ele- ments of a claim will guide the suit throughout litigation. Comcast Corp. v. Nat\\u2019l Ass\\u2019n of Afr. Am.-Owned Media, 589 U.S. 327, 332 (2020). In Comcast Corp., the Court held that while the difficulty to satisfy the elements of a claim may increase, the elements themselves do not change: Normally, too, the essential elements of a claim remain constant through the life of a lawsuit. What a plaintiff must do to satisfy\",\n          \"77  Despite those efforts, a group of experts submitted a report to the International Whaling Commission (\\u201cIWC\\u201d)4 Scientific Committee in 2017 that calculated the Maui dolphin\\u2019s potential biological removal level (\\u201cPBR\\u201d).5 See First Suppl. Compl. \\u00b6 57. That study indicated that in order for the Maui dolphin\\u2019s stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable level, the subspecies can sustain the human- induced loss of only one individual roughly every 20 years. Id. Ac- cording to another 2019 study considered by the IWC, the estimated mean annual bycatch mortality for Maui dolphins in recent years was 1.8 to 2.4 individuals per year. See id. \\u00b6 58. That bycatch mortality rate vastly exceeded the PBR estimated by the 2017 report. Plaintiffs also argued that New Zealand\\u2019s TMP since 2007 fell far short of a recommendation by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (\\u201cIUCN\\u201d) to ban gill net and trawl net use from the shoreline to the 100-meter depth contour off the North Island within the Maui dolphin\\u2019s range, which Plaintiffs maintained included the waters off both the west and east coasts of the island. See id. \\u00b6 58. New Zealand initiated a process to revise its TMP for Hector\\u2019s and Maui dolphins in 2018. See First Suppl. Compl. \\u00b6 80; N.Z. Answer \\u00b6\\u00b6 44, 67. Throughout this litigation New Zealand has disputed, among other facts, the IWC study\\u2019s estimation of the PBR, the ongoing mortality rate, the attribution of deaths exclusively to fishing, and the purported range of the Maui dolphin. See Sea Shepherd II, 606 F. Supp. 3d at 1297\\u201398. II. Legal Background and Procedural History Creating with certain exceptions a \\u201cmoratorium on the taking and importation of marine mammals and marine mammal products,\\u201d the MMPA aims to protect marine mammals by setting U.S. standards applicable both to domestic commercial fisheries and to foreign fish- eries that wish to export their products to the United States.6 16 4 \\u201cThe IWC was established in 1946 as the global body responsible for the management of whaling and conservation of whales. It is an inter-governmental organisation with a current membership of 88 governments,\\u201d including the United States and New Zealand. See Commission Overview, Int\\u2019l Whaling Comm\\u2019n, iwc.int/commission (last visited September 10, 2024). 5 PBR refers to the \\u201cmaximum number of animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population.\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1362(20), 1386(a)(6). 6 This court has resolved similar litigation involving the MMPA\\u2019s applicability to the critically endangered vaquita, the world\\u2019s smallest porpoise, of which only 13 individuals are estimated to remain.

Additionally, a motion for summary judgment will be granted \\u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\u201d CIT R. 56(a); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. (\\u201cLiberty Lobby\\u201d), 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). DISCUSSION Although nearly fifteen years have passed since the first entry of tires into the United States without payment of required duties for which Katana was the alleged importer of record, the lengthy admin- istrative history and considerable judicial resources which have al- ready been expended in refereeing the controversy between the gov- ernment and Katana do not change the procedural posture of the motions before the court: the parties\\u2019 respective motions are each upon the initial pleadings, the Defendant has not filed an answer to the government\\u2019s complaint, and the discovery process has not yet begun. The events which underlie the government\\u2019s claims and Ka- tana\\u2019s defenses are variously described and contested in both their substance and their import. Despite submitting and responding to a CIT Rule 56.3 statement, the parties have not yet established a body of undisputed facts that the court could rely upon in determining that no genuine dispute of any material fact exists. The court has only the parties\\u2019 pleadings and their representations made at oral argument upon which to base its determinations as to the propriety and per- suasiveness of the arguments set forth in their motions. That proce- dural posture informs and compels the court\\u2019s analysis and decisions below. I. Katana\\u2019s 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Is Denied A. The government sufficiently alleged the culpability level for an action under 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592(d). The first issue is whether the government asserted the proper level of culpability in its complaint. To survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a complaint must show the court that the pleader is entitled to relief through well-pleaded facts accepted as true. In United States v. Blum, the Federal Circuit held that independent action can be brought for unpaid duties under 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592(d) without finding the requisite culpability level under 19 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1592(a). 858 F.2d 1566, 1570 (Fed.
